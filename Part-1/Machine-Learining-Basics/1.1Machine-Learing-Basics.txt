==> Artificial intelligence is a branch of computer science that is concerned with building smart and intelligent machines.

==> Machine Learing is a technique to implement AI that can learn from the data by themselves without being explicitly programmed.

==> Deep Learning is a subfield of machine learning that uses Artificial Neural Networks to learn from the data.

======== Types of Machine Learning========

==> Machine Learing is a technique to implement AI that can learn from the data by themselves without being explicitly programmed.

1)supervised Learing : The Machine Learning algorithm learns from Labelled Data.
2)unsupervised Learning : The Machine Learning algorithm learns from Un-Labelled Data.
3)Reinforcement Learning : It is an area of Machine Learing concerned with how intelligent agents take actions in an environment to maximizze it's rewards.

Eg:Environment,Agent,Action and rewards.


======Types of Supervised Learning==========

==> supervised Learing : The Machine Learning algorithm learns from Labelled Data.

1)Classification :it is about predicting a class or discrete values.Eg:Male or Female;True or False.
    Algorithm : Decision tree clasification,Random Forest Classification ,k-nearest Nighbour.
2)Regression : It is about  Predicting a quantity or continuous values.Eg:Salary;age;price.
    Algorithm : Logistic Regression,Polynomial Regression and support vector Machines.


===========Types of Un-Supervised Learning ===============

==> unsupervised Learning : The Machine Learning algorithm learns from Un-Labelled Data.

Algorithms : K-means clustering,Hierarchical clustering,principal component Analysis,Apriori,Eclat.

1)Clustering : It is an unsupervised task which involves grouping the similar data points.
2)Association : It is an unsupervised task that is used to find important relationship between data points. Eg: Netflix
